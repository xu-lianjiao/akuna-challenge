# Market-Making Binary Options

Fill in the `MarketMaker` class in the template code. The rest of the
template file contains the objects this class operates on; you may read
them, construct them, and add helpers, but any changes you make to them
will not be reflected by the autograder.

Your market maker trades binary options (a.k.a. "event contracts") on
three daily-evolving underlyings:

1.  The fed funds rate ("FED"),
2.  The valuation of AjarAI ("AJAR"), a private frontier AI research
    lab, and
3.  The valuation of Theriodic ("THR"), a different private frontier AI
    research lab.

These options are represented by the `BinaryOption` class. Each option
pays out 1.0 at expiry if the event it represents occurs, and 0.0
otherwise. Some example events include:

-   FED rate greater than or equal to 3.0 in 3 days
-   Theriodic valuation greater than or equal to \$1tn in 5 days
-   AjarAI valuation greater than or equal to Theriodic valuation in 2
    days

Note that although the `BinaryOption` class can represent options with
any amount of legs, in practice you will only encounter single-legged
options, or "spreads" on whether AjarAI or Theriodic has a higher
valuation like the third example above.

Orders will come in via two distinct pipelines. For RFQ
(request-for-quote) orders, the exchange will request quotes from all
participating market makers, and route the order to the highest bid or
lowest offer it receives, splitting up the order if necessary.
Therefore, your `quote` method should return the most competitive prices
and quantities you are able to trade on. Note that you will not know
ahead of time whether the RFQ is a buy or sell order. FOK (fill-or-kill)
orders give you all the information up front, and it is up to you
whether you want to trade them, via your return value from
`respond_to_fok`. If multiple market makers denote that they want to
trade an FOK order, it will be broken up between them.

The evolution of the underlying prices is controlled by a joint
distribution parameterized by `MarketParameters`. The first test, THEO,
will score whether you correctly price binary options given the true
`MarketParameters` via the method `price_option_from_parameters`; the
other tests will all provide a warm-up `MarketHistory` object from which
you should estimate the true `MarketParameters`.

The first three tests after the THEO test are denoted VERBOSE --- these
are short tests which output helpful logs to assist with debugging your
`MarketMaker`. You will receive full points for these tests so long as
your code does not error and your `MarketMaker` does not go bankrupt.

The remaining 16 tests are SCORED, and your score will vary based on
your performance. You will receive full credit for being the top market
maker in the session by PnL, zero credit for going bankrupt (or code
errors), and partial credit for avoiding bankruptcy. These tests will
also vary in difficulty, including via different counterparties and
different competing market makers.

A note on bankruptcy: the autograder will keep track of cash balance,
separate of the balance you may store on your `MarketMaker`. Every time
you do a trade, your balance will decrease by the maximum loss of your
trade. So if you buy 5 contracts for \$0.20 each, your cash balance will
go down by a dollar; if you sell 5 contracts at \$0.20 apiece, your cash
balance will go down by \$4. Cash solvency is checked at the end of each
day. First, any payoffs associated with expired options will be credited
--- note that this process can only increase your balance. At this point
if your cash balance is below zero, you will be marked as bankrupt, and
the session will end early.
